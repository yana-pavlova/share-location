## ✨ About the Project

Share Location is a lightweight web app that lets you instantly create a link to any point on the map and share it with anyone. When the recipient opens the link in their browser, they'll see the exact location — no installs, no setup.

You can also save addresses to a personal list for quick access later. All data stays on the client (stored in localStorage).

Designed for convenience and privacy — everything runs locally in the browser.
